# Outsiders



### Description

This project gives a platform to find, create and share outdoor activities. It helps people host and join activities, so they can enjoy being outdoor together.

Working from home and feeling pressure to go for the obligatory (boring) run? Or just feel like kicking a ball with some others? Post a public activity and invite them! Or see if there's others already out there. Rather not walk in the park alone in the evenings? Maybe you can connect with others who want the same.

This App features:

- a GraphQL API
- a Map where activities can be found and posted
